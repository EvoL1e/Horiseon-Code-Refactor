# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description
  I was tasked with refactoring the code for Horiseon's website to make it follow accesibility standards, ensure it has semantic html elements, to make sure those elements follow a logical structure, and consolidate the CSS selectors. By adhering to accessability standards it allows people who are impaired to still find out about Horiseon and their mission. BY consolidating code as well it allows the website to have less overhead making it easier to run on lower powered devices and also easier to read for anyone else who may need to change the website's code for whatever else Horiseon may need in the future. 

## Installation
  If you wish to install this for future development you can follow these steps
    1. Fork the repository from Github
    2. Clone the repository by going to the green code button
    3. Open up GitBash (Windows) or Terminal (MacOs) and write down git clone (SSH key link from the green code button)
    4. Once cloned go to wherever you your cloned files set up to go to
    5. Open the file with your IDE of choice and start coding or right click the index.html file and and look at the website locally on your machine.
